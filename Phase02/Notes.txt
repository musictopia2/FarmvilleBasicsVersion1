For this, decided to vibe code how crafting may work.

Decided to do console so ui does not get in the way.


ran into a few minor problems.

because after something finished crafting, did not notify me (since i was using the custom menu option).

i probably pushed as far as i could with the spectre console style stuff.

i will call this a success (mostly).
