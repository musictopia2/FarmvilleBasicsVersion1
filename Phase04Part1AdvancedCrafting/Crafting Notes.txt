For crafting items, what will happen will be as follows:

1.  Show the ingredients required for each of the items being crafted.

2.  No need for progress bars (instead just show the time remaining).
3.  show how long each take (if no minutes, then s) if minutes, then m and then s
4.  for each tick, will just show the time remaining.
5.  show how much of the item you have (for each of the items supported)
6.  each also shows how many you have.

example:  11/4
means you have 11 but 4 are required.

if you don't have enough, then maybe 0/2 but would be red (different color).


details for each item crafting details (before deciding).  one is button.
