So far, i did all the advanced collection processes for:
1  crops
2  trees
3  animals


remaining are:
workshops
worksites.

for workshops, i need 2 things:
1.  has to figure out how i can make it where if i go back to main and go back, can remember what i was at.
should do that first.


the second part:
when crafting, deciding whether it can automatically pick it up or not.

currently it does.

but there is the possibility that it can't do automatically (or a person does not want to).


worksites.
for that, no issue if it goes back to the first worker again (the off the shelf one does).

i think has 3 choices:
1.  collect all.
2.  collect one by one.
3.  collect automatically.

any advanced worker processes can wait for a future version.
