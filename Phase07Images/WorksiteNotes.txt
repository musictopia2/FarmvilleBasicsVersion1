When you have to pick up the rewards:

a different ui.

for this, show the image.

needs feature where a person chooses which one you pick up.

since this was set to one at a time, then you pick up one at a time.
but ther person has a choice of which one is picked up though.

if a person cannot pick up for whatever reason, then must close out of the worksite.

show the workers that was used.
and the rewards ui.


show image
and number (how many of the reward) on bottom right.

this means there are 3 uis.


the second one is when its busy.



<div style="color: white">
             Completed.  Rethink.
         </div>
         <div style="background-color: white; height: 200px" @onclick="OnCloseManually">
             Close Me Now Temporarily.
         </div>
         this is an example of how i can close when i need to.
