so far, i did the basics for upgrades/unlocks for workshops.

did not go any further for that yet.

next, will test whether i can unlock or lock workshops.

the test would be the cow and the chicken.

has to see if i need ui upgdates or not (?)

next steps:
1.  figure out extra fields (some fields are locked to start with)
2.  figure out the trees
3.  figure out the animals
this can have extra challenge because you may need to lock options and eventually unlock options as well.
has to do with animal policy.
4.  figure out the worksites.
5.  figure out the workers.


so far, i did the animals and for workshops.
including for animals having options locked to start with (i unlock later).


parts left:
1.  fields (done)
2.  trees
3.  workers
4.  worksites.

i may have some workers a person at first does not have but later gets it.
